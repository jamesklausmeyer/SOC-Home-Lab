Set up for VLANs including subnets and DHCP
-------------------------------------------
Created sub interfaces and subnets for work stations, management devices (router, switch, etc.), guest WiFi SSID, IoT WiFi SSID, and lab devices (servers and NUCs).
Enabled DHCP on each sub interface and created reservations for most devices outside of WiFi clients
Created firewall rules enabling most traffic between subnets with the exception of WiFi to sensitive networks
