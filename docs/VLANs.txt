Set up for VLANs including subnets and DHCP
-------------------------------------------
#DHCP/Firewall
Created sub interfaces and subnets for work stations, management devices (router, switch, etc.), guest WiFi SSID, IoT WiFi SSID, and lab devices (servers and NUCs).
Enabled DHCP on each sub interface and created reservations for most devices outside of WiFi clients which are assigned dynamically
Created firewall rules enabling most traffic between subnets with the exception of WiFi to sensitive networks

#Switch config
Set up VLANs on the switch including IDs and member ports with PVIDs attached
Switch to router uplink is a trunk port with all VLANs tagged, WAP port has guest and IoT VLANs tagged, all other devices are on access ports with their respective VLANs tagged
Untagged native VLAN on all ports
Verified connectivity with pings between all subnets, most issues were caused by misconfigured ports and firewall rules
